The Oil dataset was provided by Robert Holte and is used in their paper (Kubat et al., 1998). This dataset has 41 oil slick samples and 896 non-oil slick samples.

The Mammography dataset (Woods et al., 1993)h as 11,183 samples with 260 calcifications. If we look at predictive accuracy as a measure of goodness of the classifier for this case, the default accuracy would be 97.68% when every sample is labeled noncalcification. But, it is desirable for the classifier to predict most of the calcifications correctly.
